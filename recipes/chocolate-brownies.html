        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, fudgy in the middle, 
            and made completely from scratch. These brownies are so much better than the box, 
            and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.</p>
